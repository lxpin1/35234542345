== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How it works? =
Our plugin adds the statistics counter code in a special way, so it doesn't interfere with fast page loading. Lazy loading of analytics counters allows you to get high scores. You don't need any programming knowledge. Just add the counter ID in the plugin settings.
You must remove the statistics counter code that was installed previously. Our plugin will automatically add the necessary code to your site. If you do not remove the old counter code, there will be duplicate code on the site.
